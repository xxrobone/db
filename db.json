But to survive the harsh social climate here you need to hook up with some fellow funkateers. Sven joined Concrete Kingz, which now has become one of Swedens most respected crews for their skills in breaking, popping and recently locking. At the last BBoy Summit, Sven and Dennis D Menace (Fellow Concete King) hooked up with Demons of the Mind and got their blessings to take on their style called stepping. So watch out for Left'n'Right!",
